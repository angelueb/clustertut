We will explain in a simple way the following cases:


* Using **pre-installed software**. As an example, we will be performing some Quality Control steps for RNA-Seq raw data.
* Using **Singularity containers**. As an example we'll use the pre-processed RNA-Seq data from the previous example, to perform a quasi-mapping quantification.
* Using **conda** to set up a deep learning landmark detection tool on clinical images, which will run on **GPUs**
