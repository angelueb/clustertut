In contrast to other container technologies, Singularity is a good fit to HPC environments, since:\nSingularity containers don’t need administrative privileges to be executed. Performance levels are very close to regular binaries. Compatibility with Docker images, which enables the use of a huge number of readily available existing containerized tools. Container building tools similar to Docker. Users can build custom containers using already acquired general principles. Singularity containers mount several common common storage locations, like $HOME. Also, in our cluster they are configured to mount /cscratch automatically. For these reasons, Singularity is great for running tools on the cluster without having to request the administrators to install them system-wide. Users can simply pull existing images from public repositories, or build their own, and run them as SLURM jobs, in a very similar fashion to running regular binaries.\n",
